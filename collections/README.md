PH1HS - Phase 1 Habitat Surveys
  JNCC Phase 1 Habitat Styles for mapping using QGIS

  I've uses the JNCC Phase 1 Habitat Survey Handbook and RGB colours used in the ArcMap layer classifications published in the 
  JNCC website (http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/PDF/pub10_handbookforphase1habitatsurvey.pdf)

  Each of these style files was created for QGIS v3.4 and above.
